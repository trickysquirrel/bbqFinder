//  Note: As this class contains a relationship with an end point (external web service)
//  we need to make sure this is not used in testing.  For these classes always use
//  protocols, tests are therefore required to replace the whole object.
//  If we use this as a sub class and override we might accidentally touch some code we were
//  not expecting and hit the network.
//  In this specific case googleAnalytics has a testing switch, but generally this is good practice

//  We could pass in Flurry to the classes this factory generates, but this couples

//  By passing in funcs rather than properties we ensure that all code that touches
//  the 3rd party library is kept in this class, decoupling all others.  We can then
//  easily switch to another analytic provider if needs by only amend this one class.
